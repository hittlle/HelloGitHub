This is a test project

This project tries to implement a general-purpose state machine. It uses XML to describe the triples used in a state machine(state, event and action). A sample XML file may go this way,
	<groups>
		<group>
			<state>Unspecified</state>
			<event>InitReq</event>
			<action>DoInit</action>
			<new-state>Initialized</new-state>
		</group>
		<group>
			<state>Initialized</state>
			<event>StartReq</event>
			<action>DoStart</action>
			<new-state>Started</new-state>
		</group>
	</groups>
